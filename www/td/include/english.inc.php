		<h2>Web Development</h2>
		<p>As part of our learning of dynamic web development, we will create a series of exercises in PHP. This approach will help us understand the basics of server-side programming and generate dynamic HTML content. Our goal is to practice the fundamental concepts of PHP while ensuring we produce valid code that complies with web standards.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a student at Cy University, currently in my second year of Computer Science. My professor, Marc Lemaire, has been guiding us in our web development studies since the second semester. Although we are still beginners in HTML and PHP, I particularly enjoy these languages, especially PHP, as it is similar to languages I already know, like C and Java.</p>
